When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whne you want to colaborate with other people
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This gives you more control over your version of the software
You do not want chnages made by other people to in interfere with what ever you nare working on
